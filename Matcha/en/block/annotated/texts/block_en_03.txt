Article 1. Cryptocurrency: Changing the Future of Finance 

https://medium.com/blockchain/cryptocurrency-changing-the-future-of-finance-4f775fd12196  

Cryptocurrency has been a topic of discussion for a while now, and with good reason. It has already started to change the way we think about finance. But what does the future hold for cryptocurrency? 

In this article, we will discuss where cryptocurrency is going in the next 10 years and how it will change the future of finance. 

Decentralization 

One of the main reasons cryptocurrency has the potential to change the future of finance is its decentralized nature. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are not controlled by any central authority, which means that they are not subject to government regulations or the whims of a small group of individuals. This makes them more resistant to manipulation and corruption. 

In the next 10 years, we can expect to see more and more businesses and individuals use cryptocurrency as a way to conduct transactions without the need for intermediaries. This will not only make transactions faster and cheaper but also more secure. 

Accessibility 

Another way cryptocurrency is changing the future of finance is through accessibility. 

Anyone with an internet connection can use cryptocurrency, regardless of where they are in the world. This is particularly important for people who do not have access to traditional banking services. 

Innovation 

Finally, cryptocurrency is driving innovation in the financial industry. The underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain, has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about security and transparency in finance. 

In the next 10 years, we can expect to see more and more companies harness the power of blockchain to develop new financial products and services. 

This will not only lead to more innovation but also create more competition in the financial industry, which will ultimately benefit consumers.

Article 2. The Ethereum Upgrade: Everything You Need to Know About Shanghai-Capella 

https://medium.com/blockchain/the-ethereum-upgrade-everything-you-need-to-know-about-shanghai-capella-1de5b812d6d5  

This month, Ethereum will undergo the “Shanghai-Capella” upgrade, the largest network upgrade since the “Ethereum Merge” in 2022. 

“Shanghai-Capella” will enable the withdrawal of staked ETH from the Ethereum blockchain, completing its transition from a proof of work to a proof of stake network. 

The upgrade promises to usher in a new era of scalability, sustainability and mainstream adoption for Ethereum, but what does it mean for everyday users of Ethereum? Find out below: 

When did Ethereum start its transition from a proof of work to proof of stake blockchain? 

In September 2022, the “Ethereum Merge” successfully upgraded the Ethereum network’s mainnet from an energy-intensive proof-of-work consensus mechanism to the more energy-efficient proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake lets users stake cryptocurrency to validate transactions, and in turn these users are rewarded for that participation with cryptocurrency. 

The merge, however, did not offer the ability to let individual stakers withdraw deposited Ethereum (ETH) or the rewards generated by those deposits. 

This is where the “Shanghai-Capella” upgrade comes into play, as “Shanghai-Capella” will finally enable the withdrawal of staked ETH. 

Are Shanghai and Capella two different upgrades? 

Technically, yes. 

The “Shanghai” upgrade is on the execution side of Ethereum, whereas Capella is the upgrade on the consensus side — taking place straight afterwards. 

I haven’t staked Ethereum but I do trade Ethereum, does this mean for me? 

Unless you have engaged with Ethereum staking, the upgrade will not change the way everyday users interact with Ethereum. 

I have staked Ethereum, how will this impact my Staking account? 

You can continue adding to your Blockchain.com Staking Earn Account, but for the first time you will be able to withdraw assets. 

We expect withdrawals from your Blockchain.com Staking Earn Account to be available a few weeks after the Ethereum upgrades are complete as the time taken to process withdrawals is set by the Ethereum protocol (not Blockchain.com). 

Remember, you remain liable for any taxes in relation to your Staking or other crypto products. 

While the upgrade is a huge advance forward for those who stake and the Ethereum network at large, the upgrade will have little impact upon how everyday users interact with Ethereum or the economics of the network itself.

Article 4. Our top 5 crypto resolutions 

https://medium.com/blockchain/our-top-5-crypto-resolutions-d58fe079bf49  

Make 2023 your best year in crypto 

What a year this has been for the crypto community! Despite the controversy and challenges that 2022 has brought, the New Year is upon us and we think the future is bright for crypto. 

For a fresh start in 2023, we’ve got five crypto resolutions for you to take on this year. Like all resolutions, it’s best not to overcommit, so decide what’s right for you, make a plan, and stick to it. 

Here’s the top five crypto resolutions for 2023: 

Your keys, your crypto 

If 2022 taught us anything, it’s that having control of your private keys is essential. 

A custodial wallet is useful, but there’s obviously counterparty risk involved. While a custodial wallet can be useful for using fiat currency to purchase crypto, there’s obviously counterparty risk involved in storing your crypto there. 

Using a non-custodial wallet to hold your crypto is more secure, since you control your private keys and hold your seed (recovery) phrase. This means that you can always access your assets, without permission from a third-party. 

Here are three security steps you can take today: 

First, self custody your crypto by moving it into a non-custodial wallet. With your Blockchain.com Account, you can do this in just a few steps as shown in this article. 

Then, set up two factor authentication for all of your accounts. This extra layer of security helps prevent unauthorized logins. 

Here’s how you enable 2FA on Blockchain.com: 

On desktop: 

Click the person icon in the top right corner. 

Click Security, then click Enable under Two-Factor Authentication. 

Choose your preferred 2FA method and set it up. 

On the app: 

Tap the person icon in the top left corner. 

Scroll down to Security and find 2FA. 

Use the toggle switch to enable 2FA. 

Finally, use a dedicated password manager to create unique passwords and store them securely. 

While we don’t recommend keeping your private keys or recovery phrase in a password manager, they are your best option for account login information. 

Take a long-term view 

After 11 years in crypto, we’ve seen volatile periods before, and while no one knows what the future holds, we’re confident that crypto is part of it. 

One way to take some of the emotion out of things is by using a dollar cost averaging strategy to buy crypto. 

Dollar cost averaging is a strategy in which a user periodically purchases an asset, regardless of the asset’s price. 

Purchasing in smaller amounts over time means that you’ll buy both when the price is high and when the price is low. In turn, this smooths out your average purchase price.

Learn something new 

The new year is a time for growth, and making learning a habit is a great way to do that. 

Whether you read, listen, or watch, there is more information online than ever before that will help you learn the ins and outs of crypto. If you’ve never read the Bitcoin white paper, that could be a great place to start, and resources like Khan Academy offer full courses on crypto–for free.

Join a community 

If you’re captivated by crypto, consider attending a conference, or joining a community of like-minded people. 

There are lots of crypto events coming in 2023, and plenty of meetups and social platforms to learn about more advanced crypto topics. 

Be an advocate for crypto 

If you’re like most people, you heard about crypto for the first time from someone you know. 

Based on our 2022 crypto confidence survey, nearly 40% of respondents said they will discussing crypto with friends and family over the holidays. If you’ve come to believe that crypto is the future of finance, you can help inform others about this exciting world, too. 

One way to do this is sharing articles from the Blockchain.com blog and then discussing those with your friends, or even online. 

Which of these resolutions are on your list for the new year? Let us know on Twitter! 

How to get started 

If you want to get started using crypto, the first thing you’ll need to do is create a wallet. Without this, you won’t be able to purchase, store, or swap cryptocurrencies. 

Blockchain.com is the only platform that offers a custodial and non-custodial wallet in the same place, which makes managing your crypto that much simpler.

https://medium.com/blockchain/blockchain-com-survey-reveals-crypto-investors-are-cautiously-optimistic-heading-into-2023-3eaa9530c893  

In 2022, crypto hit a new level of mainstream awareness, for better or worse. Coming off the highs of a 2021 bull run where Bitcoin topped $69,000, we end the year with fewer players and many lessons for us all. Despite the ups and downs, Blockchain.com’s long-term vision remains focused on the users — so we decided to ask how they’re feeling. 

Blockchain.com polled consumer crypto investors to gain insight regarding their thoughts and opinions in an inaugural poll, ‘Crypto Confidence: A Survey on Investor Sentiment.’ The survey focused on crypto usage and sentiment leading into the holiday season and the new year. 

More than 40,000 respondents from around the world painted a picture of cautious optimism. Despite Crypto Winter, 40% of respondents purchased crypto this year and also plan to do so in 2023, demonstrating that many investors remain measured but bullish. In addition, nearly 40% of respondents say they will discuss crypto around the holiday table this season, a clear indication that crypto has hit mainstream awareness. 

Overall results include: 

41% purchased crypto this year 

Nearly 40% plan to purchase crypto next year 

Looking at some geographic and seasonal findings, the survey revealed that certain countries are more bullish than others. 

44% of US respondents bought crypto this year and 40% plan to buy next year 

Ghana respondents are pro-crypto, with 44% purchasing crypto this year, 60% planning to next year, and 53% planning to discuss crypto at the holiday table 

Representing the largest group of respondents, 50% of Nigerians purchased crypto this year, 46% plan to next year, and 46% also plan to discuss crypto at the holiday table 

Brazilians were split almost 50/50 on purchasing crypto 

Only 34% of Germans purchased crypto this year and 30% plan to next year 

Italians were overwhelmingly skeptical of crypto, with only 31% purchasing crypto this year, 29% planning to purchase next year, and 31% planning to discuss crypto at the holiday table 

Countries with the highest responses, in order, were Nigeria, United States, United Kingdom, Ghana, and Germany. 

Methodology 

More than 40,000 people from all over the world who visited the Blockchain.com Explorer site, one of the top 3 crypto sites in terms of web traffic, responded to survey questions between November 28 — December 9, 2022.
